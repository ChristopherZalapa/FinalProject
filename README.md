## User Story

* Welcome to Party Bucket List. 
* An app where users post parties or festivals that they have either attended or want to attend.
* Since I could remember, I would go to countless parties and festivals. Every single party would come with a flyer. And of course I would collect them. Up until my drawer would be filled with them.
* Which is why I created this app. To track all the festivities that I have gone. Even the ones I have yet to attend.
